### Solar Time

Compensate for the equation of time and get the local solar time!

The 5 sines and cosines approximation used is from (Lamm, 1981), with an average error of 0.63 seconds over one year and a maximum absolute error of 2.0 seconds.

See [this page](http://www.powerfromthesun.net/Book/chapter03/chapter03.html#3.1.1 Time) from [powerfromthesun.net](http://www.powerfromthesun.net) for details on the calculation.
